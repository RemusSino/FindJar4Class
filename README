===SHORT DESCRIPTION===

This is a simple Java Swing application which helps you find the jar file(recursive search in a tree directory structure) name in which a given class resides.
It is useful if you have a library with jars and want to know in which one is your class.
It is faster than other search tools for this particular problem, because it creates an index file after the first search.

===PREREQUISITES===
Before installing and running it, make sure you have the following installed on your environment:
- Java JDK and JRE 1.7 
- MAVEN

===INSTALLATION===
After downloading the source code, go to that folder in command line and execute the following:
'mvn install' (without the quotes)

===RUNNING===
After installing, you should notice a new folder in the same path, named 'target'. 
Go in that directory and double click on the 'FindJar4Class-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar' file.

In the new window that appeared, put in the 'Lib folder' text area, the path to your folder with jars. Then press 'Load index from lib folder' 
and wait a little more, until the directory structure is indexed and the index file is created. After this first indexing, don't press on the 
'Load index from lib folder' unless you don't change something in that directory structure(add or delete jars under it) or you want to index 
the jars under a new directory.
Also, notice that a new file was created named 'indexFile.txt' which contains a mapping for every class with its enclosing jar.

Then you can type in the 'Find what' text area, the name of the class (including the package) and you will get the absolute path for the jar
file that contains it.
